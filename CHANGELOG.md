# Changelog

The following list representes the group of changes throughout the development of the project.

## [Sprint 3](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g2/tree/4f84c5aaf1fde2ff1c91d0f846a53f3374effa0b) - 2018-11-14

In the third sprint, we mostly developed on the app, with only two features on the web:

We finished the authentication on the application, via Google, and also on the web(_US#39_).

On the web, an event now shows all information of it(_US#21_ and _US#32_).

On the mobile application, we implemented the search filter(_US#44_), the search by entity(_US#6_), seeing information about an event(_US#39_) 
and favorite and unfavorite an event(_US#12_ and _US#13_ on the app and _US#37_ and _US#38_ on the api).

In order to maintain a clean code, by analysing programming errors and warnings, such as unused variables, we implemented Linter(_US#45_).
In order to keep track of the API and document it, we used openAPI(_US#47_).

With the previous implemented features from Sprint 1, we were able to list events on the web for entities, as well as being able to search by them with any kind of search.

## [Sprint 2](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g2/tree/9c2d55e624ae9ef5e13c6fe54117801b6ab8ca3d) - 2018-10-31

In the second sprint, we implemented continuous integration on the project as well a bug fix(_US#43_) and mostly search related features.
We sucessfully implemented the deletion of an event(_US#7_ and _US#33_) and the listing of events(_US#7_) for the web. We also developed searches by category(_US#5_ and _US#31_), searches by text(_US#4_ and _US#30_) and searches by entity(_US#32_) for the mobile application.

With the previous implemented features from Sprint 1, we were able to list events on the web for entities, as well as being able to search by them with any kind of search.

## [Sprint 1](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g2/tree/f0d2fa6d006ac1f4e2c596a55e981058a3d29ed4) - 2018-10-17

The first sprint consisted on the setup of the database and the development of most of the event related endpoints, such as the endpoint to return all events (_US#28_) and the endpoint to add an event(_US#2_). We also began work on the mobile application by listing events(_US#3_) and on the website by adding an event(_US#29_). Our cooperation with the designers also allowed the creation of the first mockups for the application and the website, available in the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g2/blob/dev/README.md) file.
