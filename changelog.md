# Changelog

The following list representes the group of changes throughout the development of the project.

## Sprint 1

The first sprint consisted on the setup of the database and the development of most of the event related endpoints, such as the endpoint to return all events (_US#28_) and the endpoint to add an event(_US#2_). We also began work on the mobile application by listing events(_US#3_) and on the website by adding an event(_US#29_). Our cooperation with the designers also allowed the creation of the first mockups for the application and the website, available in the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g2/blob/dev/README.md) file.

## Sprint 2
In the second sprint, we implemented continuous integration on the project as well a bug fix(_US#43_) and mostly search related features.
We sucessfully implemented the deletion of an event(_US#7_ and _US#33_) and the listing of events(_US#7_) for the web. We also developed searches by category(_US#5_ and _US#31_), searches by text(_US#4_ and _US#30_) and searches by entity(_US#32_) for the mobile application.
